Hey all! I'm the new coder for this mod I go by The_TerBobornator/Kai1006 depending on what platform it is (le stupid and inconsistant).

Anyway, imma always keep this shit open source. I'll try to keep some short explanations in comments for some things too. Just like any other mod SHOULD be, y'all are free to use this shit for whatever, even if theres not a lot going on here YET ;). Credit is always appreciated tho. All this shit is Psych Engine so creds to them of course.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me at @The_TerBobornator#1328 on Discord. I'll usually try to accept dms fast. Stay Trolling Funkers >:)
